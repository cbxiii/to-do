# To-Do List Website
An app to keep track of what I need to do on a daily basis

## Why do this project?
- I usually lose track of work I need to get done
- I wanted to practice frontend development

## Tools used
### HTML
### CSS
  The funnest part of designing this website was seeing the
  full capabilities of vanilla CSS; it was so fun to code animations!
### JS
  This was my first time learning how to make my website somewhat
  interactive, so this was a cool first learning experience with
  Javascript.
